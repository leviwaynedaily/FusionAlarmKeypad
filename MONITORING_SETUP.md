- Slow response times (>5 seconds)
- No events received in last 2 hours

### Info Alerts (Good to Know)
- Service restarted successfully
- Daily uptime report
- Weekly event processing summary

## üìä Key Metrics to Monitor

### 1. Service Availability
- Background SSE service uptime: Target 99.9%
- API endpoint availability: Target 99.5%
- Database connectivity: Target 99.9%

### 2. Event Processing
- Events processed per hour
- Time since last event
- Event processing errors

### 3. Performance
- API response times
- Memory usage (via Railway dashboard)
- CPU usage (via Railway dashboard)

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Background Service Not Running
1. Visit `/background-service` and manually start it
2. Check Railway deployment logs for errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Restart the Railway deployment if needed

### No Events Being Processed
1. Check if Fusion API is accessible
2. Verify API key is valid and has correct permissions
3. Check organization ID is correct
4. Review error logs in Railway dashboard

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify Supabase connection string is correct
2. Check Supabase service status
3. Confirm database tables exist
4. Test database connection from Railway logs

## üîó Quick Links

Once deployed, bookmark these URLs (replace `your-app.railway.app`):

- **System Dashboard**: https://your-app.railway.app/monitoring
- **Background Service**: https://your-app.railway.app/background-service
- **Health Check**: https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
- **Simple Monitor**: https://your-app.railway.app/api/monitor

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Set up multiple monitoring services** for redundancy
2. **Use different alert channels** (email + SMS + push notifications)
3. **Monitor during known busy periods** to establish baseline metrics
4. **Test your monitoring** by intentionally stopping the service
5. **Document your alert procedures** for quick response
6. **Set up calendar reminders** for monthly monitoring reviews

With this monitoring setup, you'll have complete visibility into your system's health and can be confident that events are being captured 24/7, even when you're not actively using the application.
